Linting with eslint found some issues. The output above should give some
details.

If this looks like a false negative, you can skip this test by adding the
"--no-verify" flag to your "git push" command. Please consider opening a
new issue at https://github.com/twilio-labs/function-templates if you need
to repeatedly use the "--no-verify" flag for valid code.
