# The runtime-helpers Utility Library

This is a set of useful utility code for use in Twilio Runtime and Twilio
Functions applications. See our
[autogenerated API documentation](https://twilio-labs.github.io/runtime-helpers/)
for usage examples.

## Goals

`runtime-helpers` is a curated collection of code we've found useful in working
with the Twilio Runtime platform and Twilio Functions. Much of this repository
is adapted from commonly-used Function code written for popular Quick Deploy
apps. Compared with copy-pasted versions of the same code, the utilities in
`runtime-helpers` have the following advantages:

- All code is typechecked via Typescript and has a full set of unit tests
- Any improvements we make can easily be incorporated into your app via standard NPM mechanisms
- We provide a single, trusted implementation for security-conscious code
- The `runtime-helpers` API is consistent; multiple conflicting implementations of functions are not possible
